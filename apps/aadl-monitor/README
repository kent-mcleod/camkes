This application demonstrates the use of dataport wrapper to pass pointers via CAmkES RPC
across different components. Although users still need to declare a dataport and cannot
have pointers in the user-defined structure, users do not need to worried about how
arguments are encapsulated and can have a cleaner interface at least.
