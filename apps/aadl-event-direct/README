This application demonstrates the use of a counter to implement AADL event
port semantics.  This provides one-way data flow from the sender to the
receiver without loss of events. The implementation supports a single producer
and any number of receivers. Three styles of recover are supported:

polling - Non-blocking check for an event.  This is intended to be used in
cases where there is some natural wait time for poll interval such as a periodic
wait. This is the typical style used for safety critical realtime systems.

wait - Blocking wait for an event.

callback - When an event is sent, the receiver calls a callback function on some
arbitrary thread.
